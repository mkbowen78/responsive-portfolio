          Several years ago I created a card game that I had hoped would replace UNO in homes around the world as the game of choice for family fun. I used my graphic design skills and lots of Googling to piece together a great looking, but poorly functioning website. It didn't take long for it to become painfully clear that the "if you build it, they will come" strategy only worked in the movies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I may not have taken my game to legendary sales, but I developed a curiosity for web design and development, as well as digital marketing. Last year, I was inspired by my growing passion for tech to leave federal employment and seek out training in e-commerce, digital marketing and web/mobile development.

            When I'm not learning new coding skills, I enjoy traveling, drawing and debating zombie apocalypse movies. I also have a serious crush on cookies - but who doesn't, amirite?

          Thanks to the intensive Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas at Austin, I have begun to earn extensive skills that I'll use to contribute to the creation of incredible web and mobile application experiences.
